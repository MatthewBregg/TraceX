  <li><a href="https://excelsior.asc.ohio-state.edu/~carlson/history/tree/magi.html"> MAGI (Mathematical Applications Group, Inc.) used ray casting to trace radiation from the source to the surrounding environment. This software was eventually adapted for use in CGI, becoming one of the first implementations of ray tracing used to generate images. Later, MAGI used this software to create scenes in the movie Tron (1982).  </a></li>

This paper introduces a recursive ray tracing algorithm. When a ray intersects an object, it may generate up to three more rays which are used to simulate reflection, refraction, and shadows. This algorithm is more expensive than its predecessors, but it results in very realistic images. </a></li>
